> # Minecraft Among Us
> #### Minecraft Among Us brings the popular social deduction game 'Among Us' to Minecraft on Bedrock platforms, but beware as 1 or more of the members on the ship are an Impostor, only looking to kill innocent crewmates.
> ### 4 Impostors Among Us
> #### I've added the ability to have as much as 4 impostors among the crew, which means more chaos with up-to 20 players being a viable game setting.
> ### Settings Editor
> #### The settings editor is only available to those considered a certified member of the room. By default, whoever is hosting the world should be certified, but if not simply add the tag 'certified' to yourself, or others!
>
> > ##### Downloads for Minecraft Among Us [beta.pre.100] are releasing on December 11th at 2:00 PM EST.
>
> > ### Changelog
> > #### No Changes Specified
