## Minecraft PE Version List
### Archiving Minecraft's History on Android devices
#### Has it ever seemed hard to track down old versions of Minecraft? Has it seemed like any builds have seemingly vanished from existence? Well, not anymore! I plan to use the official list of updates provided on Minecraft's own websites and use common patterns in version codes to compile a list of versions, all working. It won't be easy though, which is why (at least for now) access to the Minecraft Version Downloader will be restricted to a small group of people while the project is ongoing. In the future, when it's less of a concept and more of a real thing, I will provide the switcher apk. For now, you can use the JSON data anywhere.

#### Access to the Version Downloader is limited but you can use the JSON response data with other applications
