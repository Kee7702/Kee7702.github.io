## Minecraft PE Version List
### Archiving Minecraft's History on Android devices
#### Has it ever seemed hard to track down old versions of Minecraft? Has it seemed like many builds have seemingly vanished from existence? Well, not anymore! I plan to use the official list of updates provided on Minecraft's own websites along with common patterns in version codes to compile a list of versions, all working. It won't be easy though, which is why (at least for now) access to the Minecraft Version Downloader will be restricted to a small group of people. In the future I will compile my own APK allowing it to be more easily sharable and have support for other applications.

#### Access to the Version Downloader is limited but you can use the JSON response data with other applications
