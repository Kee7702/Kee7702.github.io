## KeeCapes Database Restructuring
<div class="changelog-container"><h4>November 15th, 2022</h4><h3>KeeCapes Database Restructuring</h3><h4>KeeCapes, over 2 years, has had a total of 20 updates. It's never been formatted for modern Keeterial, and as such I've deemed it a requirement to entirely purge the legacy KeeCapes database and begin rebuilding pages. Here's the plan...</h4><h3 style="display:block">Compile Capes</h3><h4>I'll be looking through the contents of every legacy build, grabbing capes from every version and comparing new additions to establish proper changelogs.</h4><h3 style="display:block">Grab Preview Images</h3><h4>In total, 3 total images have been made. I'll have to grab each image in relation to each build.</h4><h3 style="display:block">Keep links the same</h3><h4>The formatting of each page must be kept the same</h4></div>
