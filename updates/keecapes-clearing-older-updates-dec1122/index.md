## Clearing Older Updates
<div class="changelog-container"><h4>December 11th, 2022</h4><h3>Clearing Older Updates</h3><h4>Due to changes to the way KeeCapes pages have been redesigned, I've desided to hide the database of past KeeCapes revisions. These builds might appear in the future, but for now there's simply a new 2.0 release and that's all you can indirectly access. Through direct links, you can stll download these builds after some changes.</h4></div>
