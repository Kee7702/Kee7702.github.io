## MP3 Player
![MP3 Player Logo](./upload/mp3-player_0.png)
### Fast, simple, compact music player for LittleBigPlanet 3
## MP3 Player 2.1
#### 2.0 was kind of a mess upon release, especially on PS3. I want this project to be usable, so I've been cleaning up internals and working around limitations in LBP. This update will also be bringing back some concepts from earlier builds, and removing all previous Wireless API protocols to prepare for Wireless v2.
## Features coming to future updates
### These features are planned but are currently pending development due to one or more factors.
