#### MP3 Player is a project in LittleBigPlanet, meant to be a mass collection of music, conveniently sorted into playlists, browsable in any level which this is a part of, with several features currently in development.
## Main Features
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">Wireless API</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">A full api to insert additional playlists into the player</h4><h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">Interactive Selection</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">Play IntMusic with more control</h4>
## Features In Development
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">Wireless Exclusivity</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">Each distributed MP3 Player build in the future will have an assigned wireless device ID, and this ID allows exclusive tracks to load.</h4><h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">Interaction+ API</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">An experimental API exclusive to partners which would be able to manipulate the core mechanics through a series of protocol redirections and specification.</h4><h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">Full MusicPlayer Support</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">Completed support for MusicPlayer Playlists integrated into the main track selector.</h4><h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">Inclusion API</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">Although it has an odd name, this API is actually a internal version of Wireless API. It allows a set of playlists to be inserted before wireless playlists.</h4><h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">External Playlists</h3><h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;margin-bottom: 8px;">To lower thermometer requirements for MP3 Player, a special module will be built to make the contents of each playlist not physically attached to MP3 Player. The inclusion of IntMusic takes much more space than intended, so it will be removed from any instances of MP3 Player which are in larger levels.</h4>
## Features Forgotten
### There is generally a lot of planning into features before a proper concept is even made. As such, it should be no surprise that there is some functionality which was replaced, cancelled or later removed.
