## KeeCapes (Mar 25th, 2022)
#### KeeCapes is a skin pack made for Minecraft with the intention to give players a library of capes that won't be too large in size. KeeCapes only includes official capes and very few unofficial capes, meaning all included capes are high in quality.
#### Installation of this skin pack is easy if you know what you're doing, but may be complicated if you aren't sure. First, I'll say that adding this skin pack to the iOS version is likely impossible. To add the pack to Windows 10 however, it is very easy if you install the [Unofficlal Bedrock Launcher](https://github.com/BedrockLauncher/BedrockLauncher.Installer/releases/latest/download/BedrockLauncher.Installer.exe) and then modify the unpacked minecraft version you have installed. Using this method is easy because it allows easy access to the internal files of Minecraft. For Android, you need to use something like an APK Editor, however the most common apk editor is no longer found on the Google Play Store, therefore you'll have to find it on your own. After you have a reliable way to access the game's internal skin packs, save the persona skin pack to your external storage, and then replace it with KeeCapes. This should give a working cape pack that will be visible to other players, however if you aren't able to get this to work, I recommend using the resource pack once it's available.
