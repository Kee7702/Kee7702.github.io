## Dreams Audio Importing
> ## Conditions
> ### Import requests must be under or around 3 minutes. This is not because of any technical limit, it is simply because every 15 seconds added is extra time required to complete the import process, and my time on Dreams is currently filled with working on both the Among Us sound pack an the Minecraft music pack. This means that when I'm moreso 'free', I may raise this limit.
> ### Import requests must not be from games which are meant for mature audiences. I have no issue importing those sounds, but feel that those types of sounds do not belong in Dreams.
> ### Import requests must be official. No meme sounds will be accepted.

### If you believe that these rules are too much, [import audio yourself](https://indreams.me/import/audio), but then I will not be at fault if your sound gets removed.
